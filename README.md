basic java calculator with a previous number logging button
It is a calculator using java, html and css, it has four buttons: add 1, minus 1, divide 2, multiply 2 and zero out so it is not a complete calculator but can still calculate things in a simple way. It also has a number logging feature wich can log a previously calculated number. This calculator is not practical nor efficient at all, just something basic that I made whilst learning super basic java.
